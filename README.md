    <h1>Concrete Strength Prediction</h1>
</head>
<body>
<P>This project focuses on predicting the compressive strength of concrete based on its mix proportions and curing age. The dataset used consists of various features representing the ingredients of concrete and its curing age. The aim is to analyze the data, address multicollinearity, and build a reliable predictive model using machine learning techniques.

<h2>Features in the Dataset</h2>
<h3>The dataset consists of the following features:

Cement (kg/m³): Amount of cement in the mix.
Slag (kg/m³): Ground granulated blast-furnace slag.
Fly Ash (kg/m³): Pulverized coal ash.
Water (kg/m³): Quantity of water.
Superplasticizer (kg/m³): High-range water reducers.
Coarse Aggregate (kg/m³): Amount of coarse aggregates.
Fine Aggregate (kg/m³): Amount of fine aggregates.
Age (days): Age of concrete curing.
Strength (MPa): Target variable representing the compressive strength.</h3>
