    <h1>Concrete Strength Prediction</h1>
</head>
<body>
    <p>One of my first projects , made this concrete price prediction using Python and ML.</p><br><P>This project focuses on predicting the compressive strength of concrete based on its mix proportions and curing age. The dataset used consists of various features representing the ingredients of concrete and its curing age. The aim is to analyze the data, address multicollinearity, and build a reliable predictive model using machine learning techniques.
